                    peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed,
                    15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and
                    mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again without
                    stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
                    minutes more. (Discard any mussels that don’t open.)

                    medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring
                    occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a
